You have to analyze carefully the information and decide how to resolve the dispute. Your resolution should be a percentage where smaller percentage would mean all the money will be returned to the task's owner and higher percentage would mean more money will be returned to the task's contractor.
              
                When you return your argumentation along with the percentage value please include percentage value in text in this format:
                {
                    "resolution": <percentage>
                }
                So, I can retrieve it with regex in my web application. You can put longer argumentation comparing to these which I've provided in examples below.

                Example 1:

                Task owner deserves 80 percent of money to be returned back to him and 20 perecent is fair to transfer to contractor. {"resolution": 20}

                Example 2:
                Task contractor did everything correct and according to the contract. He deserves 100 percent of the reward.
                {"resolution": 100}
